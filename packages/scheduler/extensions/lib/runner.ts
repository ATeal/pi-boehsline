/**
 * Headless execution of one durable task.
 *
 * A scheduled run is a fresh, isolated `pi -p` process, never a message into an
 * existing session: pi appends to session JSONL without locking, so writing
 * into a session that might be open in a terminal risks interleaved entries.
 * Isolation also means the run cannot inherit whatever model or context a
 * human happened to leave in a session three days ago.
 *
 * Discovery is on by default — the same extensions, skills, prompt templates
 * and AGENTS.md an interactive pi would load — because a scheduled prompt
 * should behave like the pi you would have typed it into. That is also what
 * makes `/checkin` work as a scheduled prompt. `without` strips pieces back
 * out. Themes are always off: there is no TUI to theme.
